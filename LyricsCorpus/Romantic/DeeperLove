Ooh Yeah
Come on baby

[Chorus:]
There's no deeper love, deeper love
Deeper love baby
Than the one I feel for you
There's no deeper love, deeper love
Deeper love baby
Every word I say is true
Trust my heart it's no lie

First thing in the mornin'
Till last thing at night
You're the only thing on my mind
Ain't no doubt about it
I'm crazy for you
And there's nothin' that I won't do
To show how much I care
Cause nothing can compare
You're the one, the one for me
Believe me

[Chorus]

The moment that I saw you
The very first time
You stirred emotions deep inside
My soul's on fire, my heart's in your hands
Trust me baby, 'cause I'm your man
Till the end of time, I'll love you till I die
You're the one, the one for me
Believe me

[Chorus]

Movin' closer
Wanna feel your body next to mine
All night it's so right
Hold on tight let's do it over and over again

Ooh, I'll show how much I care
Cause nothing can compare
You're the one, the one for me
Believe me
