Here she comes, ooh just like an angel
Seems like forever that she's been on my mind
But nothing has changed
She thinks I'm a waste of her time

There she goes
She don't know what she's missing
Can't she see I'll never give up the fight
I'll do all I can till she understands my desire

I've been on the outside looking in
Let me into your heart, oh
There's nothing on earth
That should keep us apart
Baby

[Chorus:]
I can't live without your love and affection
I can't face another night on my own
I'd give up my pride to save me from being alone
'Cause I can't live without your love

So I wait, here for an answer
And wonder if tomorrow will be like yesterday
I'll keep holding on
But I can't go on living this way
Baby

I've been on the outside looking in
Bring these tears to an end, oh
I realize there's no use for me to pretend
Oh yeah

[Chorus]

For your love
I'd put my arms around you
For your love
I'd find the strength to tell you
For your love
I can't live without your love
