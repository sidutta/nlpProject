Maybe I don't wanna know the reason why
But lately you don't talk to me 
And baby I can't see me in your eyes

I hold you near but you're so far away
And it's losing you I can't believe
To watch you leave and let this feeling die

You alone are the living thing that keeps me alive
And tomorrow if I am here without your love you know I can't
survive
Only my love can raise you high above it all

[Chorus x4]
Don't throw it all away our love (our love)
Don't throw it all away our love

Don't throw it all away [x2]

We can take the darkness and make it full of light
Let your love flow back to me 
How can you leave and let this feeling die

This happy room will be a lonely place when you are gone
And I won't even have your shoulders for the crying on
No other man's love could be as true, I'm beggin you

[Chorus]

You alone are the living thing that keeps me alive
And tomorrow if I am here without you love you know I can't
survive
Only my love can raise you high above it all

(So high...above it all)
Don't throw it all away our love (our love)
Don't throw it all away our love 
(So high...above it all)
Don't throw it all away our love (our love)
Don't throw it all away our love

[x2 fade out]
Don't throw it all away our love (our love)
Don't throw it all away our love
