If I should stay
I would only get in your way
So I'll go
But I know
I'll think of you every step of the way

[with music]

And I will always love you
I will always love you
My darling, Mmmmmmmm
Bittersweet memories
That is all I'm taking with me
So goodbye
Please don't cry
For we both know
I'm not what you need
And I will always love you
I will always love you

[musical interlude]

I hope life treats you kind
And I hope you have all you dreamed of
And I wish you joy and hapiness
But above all this I wish you love

And I will always love you
I will always love you
I will always love you
I will always love you
I will always love you
I will always love you
