You know I'm gon get ya, yeah
Whatever it takes to, get there
No I won't drop you
Like everybody else does

Forget about your friends they don't care where we go
If they do, we'll get lost in a crowd of people
I've been looking for you forever baby we go
Together baby we go, we go

In this crazy world the choices i've only got a few
Either you're coming with me, or i'm coming with you
Cause I finally found, I finally found you
You never have to worry if for us it's true
Girl i've been looking for you
And when I saw you I knew
That I finally found, I finally found you

[beat break]

I'm coming i'll get ya, yeah
We have a connection, that's right
This girl i'm not letting go
I'm gonna make you feel right, oh yea

Forget about your friends they don't care where we go
If they do, we'll get lost
in a crowd of people
I've been looking for you forever baby we go
Together baby we go, we go

In this crazy world the choices i've only got a few
Either you're coming with me, or i'm coming with you
Cause I finally found, I finally found you
You never have to worry if for us it's true
Girl i've been looking for you
And when I saw you I knew
That I finally found, I finally found you

[beat break]

I finally found, I finally found you

[Sammy Adams]
Yeah, can I get love, too much to ask for
Really so tough, fight yourself, move away
Way to sex in the drums
Got my hands full, grabbing on girls skirts
Hands up, hands up, just flo chilling with ho two cups
Can't stop spilling, cause i'm drunk as f-ck
And my song comes on, and the club goes nuts
Everytime the side goes, seems to ya sleep, best to ya know
Running around, and doing all these shows
Round the whole globe, and come, and you go girl
Ain't it need to think of it
Just wrap for the night, baby live a bit
With a place to hit, and your plans to see it
You can make a scene and party, are you into it

In this crazy world the choices i've only got a few
Either you're coming with me, or i'm coming with you
Cause I finally found, I finally found you

Finally finally finally found you
Finally finally finally found
Finally found, I finally found you

You know I will get ya
