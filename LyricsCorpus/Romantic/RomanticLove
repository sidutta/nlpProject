It’s really strange. How did you notice everything?
The words I want to hear and my everything that I want to do! oh ~
As if you came into my mind secretly.
You show up in front of me though I only think of you.

I pinch my cheek because I’m not sure if it’s a dream.
But you’re in front of me, smiling so brightly.

My romantic guy, my heart flutters. I fell in love with you.
I haven’t felt such thing before. You talk to me with smile.
My romantic love, you’re better than expected.
Your dazzling smile wakes me up pit-a-pat even on the tiring days.

I’ll have you. I hope there’s only me who haves you.
This thrilling feeling, I think of that dizzy day oh와
I burst out laughing again and again although I’m watching a sad movie.
What kind of spells did you cast?

I feel like one day is too short because of you.
Time might get jealous. You’re romantic my love.

My romantic guy, my heart flutters. I fell in love with you.
I haven’t felt such thing before. You talk to me with smile.
My romantic love, you’re better than expected.
Your dazzling smile wakes me up pit-a-pat even on the tiring days.

I don’t want to miss this dreamlike time.
God gave you.

I’ll get stuck in your arms.
Take my love.

Yes I love you I love you you already know my mind.
I say to you, shouting, because I’m not sure if you talk to me first.
That I love you I love you more. The words ringing in my ear.
What planet are you on? I’m so thankful to the planet because it sent you to me.
