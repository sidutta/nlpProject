Don't know much about history,
don't know much biology.
Don't know much about a science book,
don't know much about the french I took.
But I do know that I love you,
and I know that if you love me, too,
what a wonderful world this would be.

Don't know much about geography,
don't know much trigonometry.
Don't know much about algebra,
don't know what s slide rule is for.
But I know that one and one is two,
and if this one could be with you,
what a wonderful world this would be.

I don't claim to be an 'A' student,
but I'm tryin' to be.
For maybe by being an 'A'-student, baby,
I can win your love for me.
