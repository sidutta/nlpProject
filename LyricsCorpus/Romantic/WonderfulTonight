It's late in the evening, she's wondering what clothes to wear
She puts on her make up and brushes her long blonde hair
And then she asks me, "Do I look alright?"
And I say, "Yes, you look wonderful tonight"

We go to a party and everyone turns to see
This beautiful lady, that's walking around with me
And then she asks me, "Do you feel alright?"
And I say, "Yes, I feel wonderful tonight"

And I feel wonderful
Because I see the love light in your eyes
And the wonder of it all
Is that you just don't realize how much I love you

It's time to go home now and I've got an aching head
So I give her the car keys and she helps me to bed
And then I tell her, as I turn out the light
I say, "My darling, you were wonderful tonight
Oh my darling, you were wonderful tonight"
