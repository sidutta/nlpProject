What am I going to get you girl
I wanna buy you the whole wide world
All I got is a letter jacket and a mood ring

Sometimes I see you standing in the hall
and I can't say a thing at all
Deep inside I'm writing you poetry

Yes, I am

I almost love you
I can almost feel your kiss
Almost promise my heart
But my promise is more like a wish
Oh, I don't know what all this means
But girl I can't get you out of my dreams
Everytime that we get close
It's almost

Yesterday I saw you on the hood of a car
With an older guy, he was playing his guitar
You gave him your smile, I could have cried but I just froze

Should I stand up to him
Should I pick a fight
Should I get you to run away with me tonight

I don't know how to get there
Or where we'd go
Don't you know

I almost love you
I can almost feel your kiss
Almost promise my heart
But my promise is more like a wish
Oh, I don't know what all this means
But girl I can't get you out of my dreams
Everytime that we get close
It's almost

Love, it's almost the right stuff
It's almost the flight of a pure white dove
It's almost true love

I almost love you
I can almost feel your kiss
Almost promise my heart
But my promise is more like a wish
Oh, I don't know what all this means
But girl I can't get you out of my dreams
Everytime that we get close
It's almost

Love, it's almost the right stuff
It's almost the flight of a pure white dove
It's almost true love

It's almost true love
It's almost the right stuff
It's almost the flight of a pure white dove
It's almost true love, yeah
