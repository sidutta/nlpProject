When a man loves a woman 
Can't keep his mind on nothing else 
He'll change the world
For the good thing he's found 
If she's bad he can't see it 
He can do her no wrong
Turn his back on his best friend 
If he put her down 

When a man loves a woman 
Spend his very last dime 
Tryin' to hold on to what he needs 
He'd give up all his comfort 
Sleep out in the rain 
If she said that's the way it ought to be

Well, this man loves a woman 
I gave you everything I had 
Trying to hold on to your high-class love
Baby, please don't treat me bad 

When a man loves a woman 
Down deep in his soul 
She can bring him such misery 
If she plays him for a fool 
He's the last one to know 
Lovin' eyes can't ever see 

When a man loves a woman 
He can do no wrong 
He can never want some other girl
Yes when a man loves a woman 
I know exactly how he feels 
'Cause baby, baby, baby, you're my world 

When a man loves a woman.....
