Don't Worry, Be Happy Lyrics

Here's a little song I wrote
You might want to sing it note for note
Don't worry, be happy

Every life we have some trouble
When you worry you make it double
Don't worry, be happy ho
Don't worry, be happy now

Don't worry, be happy
Don't worry, be happy
Don't worry, be happy
Don't worry, be happy

Ain't go no place to lay your head
Somebody came and took your bed
Don't worry, be happy

The landlord say your rent is late
He may have to litigate
Don't worry, be happy
Look at me, I'm happy

Don't worry, be happy
I give you my phone number
When you worried, call me
I make you happy

Don't worry, be happy

Ain't got no cash, ain't got no style
Ain't got no gal to make you smile
But don't worry, be happy

'Cause when you worry your face will frown
And that will bring everybody down
So don't worry, be happy
Don't worry, be happy now

Don't worry, be happy
Don't worry, be happy
Don't worry, be happy
Don't worry, be happy

Now there, this song I wrote
I hope you learned it note for note
Like good little children
Don't worry, be happy

Listen to what I say
In life we have some trouble
But when you worry you make it double
Don't worry, be happy, be happy now

Don't worry, be happy
Don't worry, be happy
Don't worry, be happy
Don't worry, be happy

Don't worry, don't worry, don't do it
Be happy
Put a smile on your face
Don't bring everybody down like this

Don't worry
It will soon pass, whatever it is
Don't worry, be happy

I'm not worried
I'm happy
