With a drink in her hand
She will stop her car and then
Seal herself for good in the garage
She's never leaving

There were times to be sure
It was so pure you might choke
But it's too late in the garage
The falling ceiling

And all the walls will fade to black
Could she be thinking of another now

Take my hand, pull me through
There's so much I left undone
But it's too late now in the garage

And all the walls will fade to black
Could she be thinking of another

They found her car still running
In the garage
She'd come so far to end her life
By the rusty mower and chicken wire
By the chicken wire and studded tire
By the rusty mower and chicken wire
